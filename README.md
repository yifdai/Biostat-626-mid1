# Biostat-626-mid1

## Experiment design and data collection

A group of volunteers, aged between 19 and 48, are recruited to participate in the experiment. They performed a protocol consisting of six activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs). The experiment also recorded postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. All participants wore a smart device on the waist during the experiment. It captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. In this context, the activities are considered outcomes, and the signals measured by the smart device are considered features. 

## Task 
First task is to build a binary classifier to classify the activity of each time window into static (0) and dynamic (1), where static postural transitions are counted as static (0).

Second task is to build a refined multi-class classifier to classify walking (1), walking_upstairs (2), walking_downstairs (3), sitting (4), standing (5), lying (6), and static postural transition (7).

## Data descrption

### Feature info
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low-pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low-pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also, the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals was calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

### Data pre-processing and description

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components. Therefore a filter with a 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. The details of the 561 features are described in files ``data_dictionary.txt`` and ``feature_info.txt``.

### Data files 

Two tab-delimited text files ```training_data.txt``` and ```test_data.txt``` are provided. The training data (labeled activity information included) should be used to construct and test your ML algorithms. Apply your algorithm to the test data (containing only feature information) and predict the activity corresponding to each time window.
